# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Topics to Tackle

1. Arrays and List -> The most common data structure
2. Stacks and Queues -> More complex list like data structure
3. Linked Lists -> they overcome the shortcomings of arrays
4. Dictonaries -> Stores data in key pair values
5. Hashing -> good for quick insertion and retrival
6. Sets -> usefull for storing unique elements
7. Binary Trees -> storing data in a hierarchial manner
8. Graphs and Graph algorithms -> ideal for modeling networks
9. Algorithms -> for sorting and searching data
10. Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
